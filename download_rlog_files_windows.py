Looking at your code, I can see a few potential issues that might prevent files from being downloaded. Let me help you debug this step by step.I've added extensive debug output to help identify why files aren't being downloaded. The main issues I found and fixed:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Added detailed debug output** - Now you'll see exactly what's happening at each step
2. **Fixed path normalization** - Ensured forward slashes are used consistently for remote paths
3. **Better error handling** - More detailed error messages to help diagnose issues
4. **Added file size reporting** - Shows the size of files being downloaded
5. **Fixed the unpacking issue** - Your original code had `dongle_id, * = run_ssh_command(...)` which was incorrect
6. **Added directory existence check** - Verifies the remote directory exists before trying to access it
7. **Optional WiFi check** - Commented out the WiFi check so it downloads regardless (you can uncomment if needed)

## Common Issues This Will Help Diagnose:

1. **Remote directory doesn't exist** - The script will now check if `/data/media/0/realdata` exists
2. **No rlog files found** - You'll see exactly how many files are found in each directory
3. **Permission issues** - Better error reporting for SFTP operations
4. **Device not offroad** - Clear indication of the IsOffroad status

## To Debug Further:

Run the updated script and look for these key pieces of information in the output:

- Does it successfully connect via SSH?
- What does `IsOffroad` return? (should be "1")
- Does the remote directory `/data/media/0/realdata` exist?
- How many rlog files are found?
- Are there any SFTP errors during download?

The script will now give you much more detailed information about what's happening at each step, which should help identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
